# Voice Features Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Network Error (Most Common)

**Error Message:** "Network error. Speech recognition requires an internet connection."

**Cause:** The Web Speech API in Chrome/Edge uses Google's cloud-based speech recognition service, which requires an active internet connection.

**Solutions:**

#### Check Your Internet Connection
1. Verify you're connected to the internet
2. Try opening another website to confirm connectivity
3. Check if you're behind a firewall or proxy that might block the speech API

#### Browser-Specific Solutions

**Chrome/Edge:**
- The speech recognition API requires internet access
- Make sure you're not in offline mode
- Check if your network allows connections to Google services
- Try disabling VPN if you're using one

**Safari:**
- Safari uses Apple's speech recognition
- May work offline on macOS/iOS devices
- Ensure you have the latest Safari version

**Firefox:**
- Limited support for Web Speech API
- May not work reliably
- Consider using Chrome or Edge for voice features

#### Workarounds
1. **Use Safari** (if on macOS/iOS) - it has better offline support
2. **Check Network Settings** - ensure your firewall isn't blocking the API
3. **Try a Different Network** - corporate networks may block speech APIs
4. **Use Mobile Hotspot** - if your main network has restrictions

### 3. No Speech Detected

**Error Message:** "No speech detected. Please try again."

**Causes:**
- Microphone not working
- Speaking too quietly

- Wrong microphone selected

**Solutions:**
1. **Test Your Microphone:**
   - Go to your system settings

### 4. Speech Recognition Not Available

**Error Message:** "Speech recognition not available in this browser"

**Cause:** Your browser doesn't support the Web Speech API

**Solutions:**
1. **Update Your Browser:**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version
   - Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Opera have the best support

2. **Switch Browsers:**
   - **Recommended:** Chrome or Edge (best support)

### 5. Text-to-Speech Not Working

**Symptoms:** Speaker button doesn't work or no sound plays

**Solutions:**

1. **Check System Volume:**
   - Ensure system volume is not muted
   - Check browser tab is not muted (look for speaker icon on tab)

2. **Check Browser Permissions:**
   - Some browsers may block autoplay audio
   - Try clicking the speaker button again

3. **Reload Voices:**
   - Refresh the page
   - Voices may take a moment to load on first page load

4. **Browser-Specific Issues:**
   - **Chrome/Edge:** Usually works well
   - **Safari:** May need user interaction first
   - **Firefox:** Check if audio is enabled in settings

### 6. Voice Input Stops Immediately

**Symptoms:** Recording starts but stops right away

**Causes:**
- Network interruption
- Microphone access revoked
- Browser bug

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Network Stability:**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Avoid switching networks while recording

2. **Restart Recognition:**
   - Click the microphone button again
   - Wait a moment before speaking

3. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Restart browser
   - Try again

---

### 7. HTTPS Required Error

**Error Message:** "Speech recognition requires HTTPS"

**Cause:** Web Speech API requires a secure connection (HTTPS) except for localhost

**Solutions:**
1. **For Development:**
   - Use `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1` (these are allowed)
   - No HTTPS needed for local development

2. **For Production:**
   - Deploy with HTTPS enabled
   - Use services like Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
   - Most hosting providers offer free SSL

## Best Practices

### For Best Voice Recognition Results:

1. **Environment:**
   - Use in a quiet environment
   - Minimize background noise
   - Close windows to reduce outside noise

2. **Microphone:**
   - Use a good quality microphone
   - Position 6-12 inches from your mouth
   - Avoid touching or moving the microphone while speaking

3. **Speaking:**
   - Speak clearly and at normal pace
   - Use natural speech patterns
   - Pause briefly between sentences

4. **Network:**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Avoid using on slow/unreliable networks
   - Consider using wired connection for best results

### For Best Text-to-Speech Results:

1. **Content:**
   - The system automatically removes code blocks and markdown
   - Long messages may take a moment to start

2. **Control:**
   - Click speaker button again to stop playback
   - Only one message can play at a time

## Technical Details

### Network Requirements

The Web Speech API (specifically `SpeechRecognition`) in Chrome/Edge requires:
- Active internet connection
- Access to Google's speech recognition servers
- Ports: Standard HTTPS (443)
- No proxy/firewall blocking Google services

### Why Internet is Required

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Uses Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Processes audio on Google's servers
- Provides high accuracy but requires internet

**Safari:**
- Uses Apple's speech recognition
- May work offline on Apple devices
- Processes locally when possible

### Privacy Considerations

When using voice input:
- Audio is sent to cloud services (Chrome/Edge)
- No audio is stored by this application
- Transcribed text is treated as normal input
- Check your browser's privacy policy for details

## Still Having Issues?

### Debug Steps:

1. **Open Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for error messages

2. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Try voice input
   - Look for failed requests

3. **Test Basic Functionality:**
   ```javascript
   // Test in browser console
   const recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
   recognition.start();
   ```

4. **Check Browser Support:**
   ```javascript
   // Test in browser console
   console.log('SpeechRecognition:', 'SpeechRecognition' in window || 'webkitSpeechRecognition' in window);
   console.log('SpeechSynthesis:', 'speechSynthesis' in window);
   ```

### Report Issues:

If you continue to experience problems:
1. Note your browser version
2. Note your operating system
3. Describe the exact error message
4. Include console errors if any
5. Describe steps to reproduce
